# Missing-Migrant-Incidents

This repository contains the analysis and visualisations of a dataset aimed at migrant incidents. The dataset contains various aspects of migration - focusing on those who are missing. With this, I have examined the routes, causes of death, regionality and temporal aspects that migrants have delt with globally to shed light on patterns on insights that can help to understand the challenges faced, and what can be done about it.
